This made it very difficult to update the software and systems, creating a <strong>high hardware dependency</strong> and making the interaction and collaboration between parties challenging. To solve these issues in a data secure way, Dentsply Sirona decided to transition its ecosystems into a new cloud architecture using Google Cloud.

Rendered frames were captured as screenshots, compressed, and transmitted via websockets.</p><p>For the production version, the focus shifted to balancing user experience with resource optimization. freiheit.com transitioned from the X11 solution to a render engine version that supported background rendering. Additionally, freiheit.com implemented WebRTC streaming for real-time frame delivery and video codec compression for further data reduction. This minimized data transfer and ensured smooth playback, even for complex scenes.</p><p>Furthermore, to optimize resource utilization, the team employed GPU timesharing, enabling concurrent rendering sessions on a single GPU. freiheit.com also incorporated intelligent scaling mechanisms that dynamically adjust resource allocation based on anticipated usage patterns.</p></div><p><strong>The team</strong> that worked on the DS Core was a symbiosis of <strong>Fullstack Software Engineers</strong> coming together to create something that had not been done before. They started with a team of 3, later becoming up to 30 engineers. Early on, they decided in agreement with Dentsply Sirona, to use Flutter/Dart as their technology as it is suitable for adaptable development and could be used for a mobile application if that&rsquo;s needed in the future.</p><div class="-mx-4 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-20 p-8 md:p-12 bg-pale-grey my-12 lg:my-20"><div class="grid grid-cols-quote gap-2"><div class="quote__symbol quote__symbol--right text-yellow pt-10" style=font-size:150px>&ldquo;</div><p class="quote__text italic">The initial development was mainly managed by freiheit alone until we reached the first Alpha Release of DS Core.

These eight clusters strategically placed across the globe, cater to the specific data residency needs of the 21 countries where DS Core operates (spanning Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Australia).</p><p>To manage the infrastructure complexity of these eight clusters and ensure consistency across them, the infrastructure was utilized as code (IaC) and abstracts cloud provider-specifics. Furthermore, GitOps principles are employed to manage the Git repository containing application manifests, enabling full traceability and version control. The CI/CD scan automates the rollout process across all eight environments.</p><p>Despite this multi-cloud, multi-regional complexity, DS Core maintains agility through a robust CI/CD pipeline with integration and smoke testing. Proactive monitoring of both infrastructure and application health is achieved through Datadog, while using a feature toggle API, that empowers management of feature rollouts and mitigates risks. This combination of automation, version control, and monitoring allows for frequent deployments while maintaining a stable and secure infrastructure for DS Core.</p></div><h3 id=taking-a-look-into-the-future>Taking a look into the future</h3><p><strong>DS Core</strong> is well on its way to becoming the <strong>most important tool</strong> for all dentists, laboratories and patients worldwide.
