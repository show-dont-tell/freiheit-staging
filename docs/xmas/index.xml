      <description>Stand with Iranian Women HÁWAR.help&amp;nbsp;→ has accompanied and supported the feminist revolution in Iran from the beginning and sees itself as an ally and an advocate for the freedom movement and for human and women’s rights in Iran. They stand up for these very rights internationally and condemn the horrible practices of the Iranian regime, which violates and disregards these rights every day.

      <description>Merry Christmas As our Xmas greeting, we decided to go the traditional route and recite the famous German poem Knecht Ruprecht by Theodor Storm. All of our members learned their lines and put on their ugliest sweater to wish you and your loved ones a Merry Xmas, Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year!
Watch your favorite project team recite the famous poem “Knecht Ruprecht” by Theodor Storm!</description>
