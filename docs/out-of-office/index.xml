      <description>Out of office We are a community of engineers from different countries and cultures all over the world. That’s because we hire the best people we can find – many different countries and lifestyles. During work hours, we build software. After work, we build friendships: from informal gatherings to community events with the entire team and everything in between. Read more about what we do to have fun out of the office.</description>

      <description>Cultural Nights As a cosmopolitan community, a lot of our members are not native to Germany. We regularly host cultural nights with food and drinks from their native countries – whether it’s Syria, Slavic countries, USA, Turkey or Egypt. At our most recent Portugal x Germany Cultural Night, we served Portuguese pastéis de bacalhau and German pretzels</description>

      <description>Hackertalks We pride ourselves on the training and the personal development of our members. That’s why this list wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be complete without hackertalks, which of course take place during work hours. Every week, engineers at freiheit.com get together to share insights into projects, discover new technologies and discuss ideas. Since they take place on Friday nights, some members enjoy a drink afterwards in our lounge on the 6th floor with a view over the port of Hamburg.</description>

      <description>Fun in Hamburg and Lisbon Our members regularly travel between our engineering hubs in Hamburg and Lisbon – like the newbies from Lisbon who come to Hamburg for their first two weeks of onboarding to connect with our company culture. Obviously, they don&amp;rsquo;t just come to work. Having fun with colleagues and exploring Hamburg is always a popular part of the trip. Every year, the whole company meets for our Summer and Christmas Events.</description>
