We regularly host cultural nights with food and drinks from their native countries – whether it’s Syria, Slavic countries, USA, Turkey or Egypt. At our most recent Portugal x Germany Cultural Night, we served Portuguese pastéis de bacalhau and German pretzels.</description></item><item><title>Hash Code Coding Challenge</title><link>https://freiheit.com/out-of-office/hash-code-coding-challenge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/out-of-office/hash-code-coding-challenge/</guid><description>Hash Code Coding Challenge Every year, freiheit.com members form teams to participate in Hash Code, Google’s annual team programming competition.

That’s why this list wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be complete without hackertalks, which of course take place during work hours. Every week, engineers at freiheit.com get together to share insights into projects, discover new technologies and discuss ideas. Since they take place on Friday nights, some members enjoy a drink afterwards in our lounge on the 6th floor with a view over the port of Hamburg.</description></item><item><title>Fun in Hamburg and Lisbon</title><link>https://freiheit.com/out-of-office/fun-in-hamburg-and-lisbon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/out-of-office/fun-in-hamburg-and-lisbon/</guid><description>Fun in Hamburg and Lisbon Our members regularly travel between our engineering hubs in Hamburg and Lisbon – like the newbies from Lisbon who come to Hamburg for their first two weeks of onboarding to connect with our company culture. Obviously, they don’t just come to work. Having fun with colleagues and exploring Hamburg is always a popular part of the trip. Every year, the whole company meets for our Summer and Christmas Events.</description></item><item><title>Sports: Running, Biking, Bouldering, Soccer and More</title><link>https://freiheit.com/out-of-office/sports/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/out-of-office/sports/</guid><description>Sports: Running, Biking, Bouldering, Soccer and More If you can name a sport, there’s probably freiheit.com members who like it.
