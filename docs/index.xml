On June 19, 2015, we are inviting friends and family of our colleagues to freiheit.com’s Open House, showing how exciting the work of a software engineer can be. After a tour through freiheit.com laboratories, we are inviting all of our guests to a summer BBQ on our panoramic rooftop terrace, overlooking St. Pauli.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/what-others-say/2015-06-10-perfect_the_enemy_of_good/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2015 19:14:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/what-others-say/2015-06-10-perfect_the_enemy_of_good/</guid><description>manager magazin - a German monthly magazine focusing on business, finance and management - publishes a collection of the best advices given in the SAAL ZWEI interview series “3 FRAGEN AN 30 FRAUEN.” (“3 QUESTIONS FOR 30 WOMEN.”). Amongst them, Claudia Dietze’s SAAL ZWEI column “Perfect is the enemy of good” has also been selected.

Among them is Claudia Dietze, who is convinced that most of the time perfect is the enemy of good. Along this corporate principle and for more than 15 years, she has been successfully leading her company towards the future.

His presentation illustrates how user behavior can be made transparent through data analysis and its evaluation, in order to better understand the client&amp;rsquo;s needs and for automated optimization for processes, products, and services.

Meanwhile, many open source machine learning software libraries exist in order to experiment with deep artificial neural networks, i.e. TensorFlow or Torch. In his presentation “Machine Learning mit künstlichen neuronalen Netzwerken in Clojure” (“Machine Learning with Artificial Neural Networks in Clojure”), Stefan Richter shows us - during the fourth code.talks in 2014 - how exciting it is to build one&amp;rsquo;s own library for artificial neural networks in Clojure.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/what-others-say/2014-06-06-wir_haben_eine_hackerkultur/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2014 13:58:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/what-others-say/2014-06-06-wir_haben_eine_hackerkultur/</guid><description>Claudia Dietze speaks of the necessity of transferring standard business models into the digital world and, furthermore, about freiheit.com’s hacker culture. freiheit.com is one of 900.000 mid-sized business customers of Deutsche Bank.

The project made freiheit.com an early adopter of HTML5, Clojure, cloud-based NoSQL database, and smartphone clients with offline syncing. In 2010, at one of the HackFwd Build Conferences on Mallorca, Stefan explains the technical architecture of the system.

This even became a small startup project: “How a Clojure pet project turned into a full-blown cloud-computing web app”.

Already in 2005, Stefan has expressed interest in Objective-C and GNUstep environment. But a pet project was missing in order to learn the language. The outcome was a presentation at the LinuxTag about algorithms in Objective-C, with which Guile Scheme programs for GNU Robot could genetically be optimized.
