&lt;p>In 2024, our engineers wrote 7,797,336 lines of code, completed 18,923 user stories and made over 62,500 commits. What a year.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Two hubs, one community</title><link>https://freiheit.com/our-community/two-hubs-one-community/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/our-community/two-hubs-one-community/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="two-hubs-one-community">Two hubs, one community&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>freiheit.com was founded in Hamburg, but it has grown far beyond that. In 2018 we opened our second engineering hub in Lisbon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our hub in Lisbon operates under the same organizational principles and team structures as our headquarters in Hamburg. The engineering members work together seamlessly and often in mixed teams between the two hubs, sharing knowledge and expertise across borders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, our members regularly travel between our engineering hubs. The newbies from Lisbon come to Hamburg for their first two weeks of onboarding to connect with our company culture. Obviously, they don’t just come to work. A big part of the trip is exploring Hamburg and enjoying time with their new colleagues. Every year, the whole company meets for our Summer and Christmas Events.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>We are a global team</title><link>https://freiheit.com/join-us/our-community/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/join-us/our-community/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="we-are-a-global-team">We are a global team.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In our Engineering Hubs in Hamburg and Lisbon you will meet people from all over the world, different cultures, colors, languages, genders and lifestyles. We celebrate diversity and openness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you ask anybody why they are working here, it is pretty likely that people will say “because of the people” and “because I have never learnt so much in my life”. Our company is a place to be yourself, aim high, taking care of each other and growing without limits.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/imprint/force-css/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/imprint/force-css/</guid><description>&lt;span class="hidden">

Each Team includes a Team Lead, who is a software engineer thyself and writes code every day. Team Leads are also usually trained as Product Owners and are appreciated as contacts for the Product Owner on the client side. A Site Reliability Engineer works with each team to automate all development and operational processes and establishes effective monitoring. Each team is completed by experienced UI/UX Designers, an Engineering Director for major technological decisions and a Commercial Lead who also keeps an eye on the team’s KPIs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Culture nights</title><link>https://freiheit.com/our-community/culture-nights/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/our-community/culture-nights/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="culture-nights">Culture nights&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Because there are so many nations present within the freiheit.com community, we host culture nights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each month one or a group of members presents their culture - cook their traditional food, show their traditional music and tell us about their traditional customs. Our members baked Polish pastries, taught the others Egyptian dances, made Indian samosas, gave the best French wine tasting… the list goes on.&lt;/p>

 We helped the coffee house and seasonal retailer Tchibo to revolutionize its multinational e-commerce website. Going from on-premises to &lt;a class="font-serif no-underline hover:text-red" href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/tchibo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud Platform&amp;nbsp;→&lt;/a> relieved the company’s IT-professionals and made it possible to break down the system’s monolithic core into microservices. Our engineers integrated dozens of interfaces to legacy-backend systems with zero downtime of the shop, minimizing impact on customer service and business transactions.

&lt;p>We see software development as an engineering discipline. We focus on simplicity, lean and iterative engineering – and fast delivery processes since our foundation and long before “agile” became a buzzword.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good software engineering means “keeping it simple”. We are building the simplest “software machine” with as few parts, mechanisms and dependencies as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simple does not mean easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Working at freiheit.com is an exciting adventure, with the goal to become a well-rounded software engineer who is able to plan, create, operate and lead large-scale systems in a team of software engineers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>We are problem solvers</title><link>https://freiheit.com/we-are-problem-solvers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/we-are-problem-solvers/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="we-are-problem-solvers">We are problem solvers.&lt;/h3>

We combine a growth mindset with long-term thinking and a can-do won’t stop attitude.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are known for our deep technical expertise and our track record of delivering successful software projects. In over two decades, we have never failed to deliver what we promised.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Both of our hubs operate under the same organizational principals and team structure. Our teams work together seamlessly, sharing knowledge and expertise across borders.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As engineers, we strive to distribute our knowledge and best practices to everyone within our company. Our goal is to make sure all team members “know what the company knows.” This reduces our reliance on individual experts and also helps us avoid making the same mistakes twice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To keep our expertise up to date, we have a lean and fast request for comments process, where all team members contribute to our knowledge base. This knowledge base is maintained by our various engineering task forces. They continuously publish fresh Knowledge Base updates for other teams to learn from and apply.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2024-12-19-adventures-ep01/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2024-12-19-adventures-ep01/</guid><description>&lt;p>“We are not leaving until this is fixed, that was clear without communication.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We didn’t see it as a risk. We still see it as an adventure. We wanted to create the company we had always looked for. A company that is more a community of highly educated, intelligent and ambitious people working in an unconventional way without vanity and politics. People who want to be pioneers and who are ready to conquer the world with us. Our people are passionate about learning and always striving for better. We felt there was a gap in the industry for just that kind of company and we wanted to make that perfect place a reality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2019-12-20-freiheit.com-supports-the-heroes-of-the-sea/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2019 17:49:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2019-12-20-freiheit.com-supports-the-heroes-of-the-sea/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hamburg/Lisbon, December 10, 2019 – The German software company freiheit.com has allocated a donation to the actual environmental project of York Hovest.

The idea «was to be one of the best in the world, not the biggest».&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="lisbon-was-a-natural-choice">Lisbon was a natural choice&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Claudia revealed how they proceeded. Before leaving Germany, they investigated which places had the best universities and selected three cities: Barcelona, Madrid and Lisbon: «During four weeks, we travelled, we worked in coworking spaces, we had meetings with the founders of other companies and withthe chambers of commerce». The choice was «easy» because it became obvious that Barcelona «was not the right location since most people there are foreigners». With view to Madrid, the situation was different. However, the city was «not open enough for international business». Lisbon «was a pleasant surprise. Everybody was enthusiastic about our idea of opening an office here and wanted to help us with the first steps». In addition to this, two of the main clients had teams or development centres in Lisbon: Daimler (through Mercedes) and Volkswagen. Until the end of the year, the company will «hire fifty new professionals». However, it is essential for freitheit.com to find people with «the right skills and the right attitude», in other words «they have to be curious and not afraid of being pioneers», emphasised the executive. From Germany, freiheit.com has brought four engineers because the objective was not to open a subsidiary «but to open an office at eye level with Hamburg, with the same culture and with the best engineers».&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2018-10-16-code.talks-2018/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 16:38:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2018-10-16-code.talks-2018/</guid><description>Some people think, that managers are not needed anymore.

&lt;p>Not so long ago, not many job positions were offered for non-engineers in the digital industry. This has changed immensely. More and more jobs are created, where even a university degree in archaeology, history, or philosophy will take you a long way in the digital industry. Here, it is more important to understand different things in context and to question them. The second machine age will not only wipe out jobs but it will bring forth many and entirely new jobs.

On May 9, 2016, we will start off the Meetup with parser combinators in Haskell. Alex Biehl is going to present the basic concept and use of parser combinators and interactively build a JSON parser and develop a personal parser combinators library on the beamer. Parsers are used almost everywhere: HTML pages in browsers, JSON, or other small, self-defined format, which need to be assembled logically for processing, in order to be mapped onto data structures. Should a library - that gets the job done - not exist, the developer must build a parser manually. The effort to use established tools such as Yacc or ANTLR is fairly high, which is why it is sometimes obvious to use the quick and dirty solution via string operation and/or standard term. In short, both comprehensibility and maintainability suffer immensely. Parser combinators are a great answer: They allow construction of complicated parsers through the combination of small, simple parsers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2016-04-19-codetalks_april_2016/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2016 18:57:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2016-04-19-codetalks_april_2016/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thomas Storck - CIO METRO Cash &amp;amp; Carry - knows the necessity of the digital transformation.
