Additionally, our members regularly travel between our engineering hubs.</description></item><item><title>We are a global team</title><link>https://freiheit.com/join-us/our-community/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/join-us/our-community/</guid><description>We are a global team. In our Engineering Hubs in Hamburg and Lisbon you will meet people from all over the world, different cultures, colors, languages, genders and lifestyles. We celebrate diversity and openness.
When you ask anybody why they are working here, it is pretty likely that people will say “because of the people” and “because I have never learnt so much in my life”.

But we know that performance is not only built on skills that are visible to us, that we learned and trained, like coding skills. Instead, performance also builds on hidden qualities that tell us how we show up when things get hard, in situations of stress, challenge or uncertainty. We call them Attributes. They are inherent to our nature and therefore harder but not impossible to develop.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2024-10-17-the-gama-team/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2024-10-17-the-gama-team/</guid><description>Our co-founder Claudia Dietze has always dreamed of taking freiheit.com international.

Even though machines are taking over more jobs that previously have been executed by humans, this development also bears a lot of opportunities for us, because we are still a valuable workforce. Nevertheless, the population declines and becomes increasingly older and many exciting jobs still remain that only someone made out of flesh and blood can do best. At the same time, the human workforce is decreasing.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2016-11-24-rowhow-sponsor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2016 16:45:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2016-11-24-rowhow-sponsor/</guid><description>From November, 25 to 27, 2016 the third Robotic Hamburg Open Workshop (RoHOW)&amp;nbsp;→ will be held at the Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH).
