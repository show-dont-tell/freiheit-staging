&lt;p>We are an engineering organization for engineers by engineers. This means engineers are in charge. They plan, build and deliver our software projects end-to-end. From the bottom to top.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our Principal Software Engineers are overarchingly responsible for all our projects, and lead all our teams with over 250+ engineers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They are the first contact for new clients and do the planning of each project right from the start until its final delivery. They make sure that we always deliver on time, on budget, on target and on quality.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
