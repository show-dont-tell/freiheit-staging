On a Wednesday in October of 2019 our Product Engineering Lead, Omar, had his first Go-Live at freiheit.com. The day before he and his colleague found a bug – that no one else had noticed and that they didn’t even cause.
Our team knew that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t leave without fixing it.

How are we successfully delivering large-scale projects to our clients always on time, on budget, on target and on quality? To deliver the right product, we need to understand the client’s needs, establish the project scope and define the right features. We always ensure that we maintain uniformity and simplicity within the code base throughout the project. Who is responsible for that?</description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2024-11-13-the-attributes-ep01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2024-11-13-the-attributes-ep01/</guid><description>At freiheit.com we hire only top ranking students. But we know that performance is not only built on skills that are visible to us, that we learned and trained, like coding skills. Instead, performance also builds on hidden qualities that tell us how we show up when things get hard, in situations of stress, challenge or uncertainty. We call them Attributes. They are inherent to our nature and therefore harder but not impossible to develop.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2024-10-02-the-freiheit-com-kudos-system/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2024-10-02-the-freiheit-com-kudos-system/</guid><description>Why are we successful?
There is one thing that brings us all together. The willingness to tackle new and interesting problems all the time. And successfully delivering them.
Becoming a well-rounded software engineer is a long journey that takes many years of hard work and learning.
When starting at freiheit.com, you are responsible for the smallest scope of work. From that on you gather experiences, learn from it and prove that you can reliably and independently handle the responsibilities of a certain level.</description></item></channel></rss>
