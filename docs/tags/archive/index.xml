Specialised in building large-scale software platforms, the internet pioneer works for the who-is-who of the European economy such as Mercedes Benz, Volkswagen, Engel &amp;amp; Völkers and METRO. The company is a partner of Google and has a team of 150 people of which 85 per cent are software engineers. The company’s name ‘freiheit’ means ‘freedom’ or ‘liberdade’ and expresses its mission – to take the freedom to create the future with its software.

of topics, such as learnings from our projects, research colleagues&lt;br>
did in their academic work, interesting pet projects, experiences with&lt;br>
new technologies, and disruptive ideas. The talks are usually&lt;br>
presented by colleagues, but we also frequently welcome guest speakers&lt;br>
from diverse areas of expertise, successful startup founders, renowned&lt;br>
scientists and open source activists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unless the talks cover internal details of a customer project, they&amp;rsquo;re&lt;br>
open to the public and we would be happy to see you there!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2019-03-06-freiheit.com-invests-in-portugal/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2019 14:52:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2019-03-06-freiheit.com-invests-in-portugal/</guid><description>&lt;p>The founder and managing director of freiheit.com, Claudia Dietze, explained to BusinessIT that the company’s name means ‘freedom’ in German and is «related to open-source software which started spreading when the company was founded». The idea «was to be one of the best in the world, not the biggest».&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="lisbon-was-a-natural-choice">LISBON WAS A NATURAL CHOICE&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Claudia revealed how they proceeded. Before leaving Germany, they investigated which places had the best universities and selected three cities: Barcelona, Madrid and Lisbon: «During four weeks, we travelled, we worked in coworking spaces, we had meetings with the founders of other companies and withthe chambers of commerce». The choice was «easy» because it became obvious that Barcelona «was not the right location since most people there are foreigners». With view to Madrid, the situation was different. However, the city was «not open enough for international business». Lisbon «was a pleasant surprise. Everybody was enthusiastic about our idea of opening an office here and wanted to help us with the first steps». In addition to this, two of the main clients had teams or development centres in Lisbon: Daimler (through Mercedes) and Volkswagen. Until the end of the year, the company will «hire fifty new professionals». However, it is essential for freitheit.com to find people with «the right skills and the right attitude», in other words «they have to be curious and not afraid of being pioneers», emphasised the executive. From Germany, freiheit.com has brought four engineers because the objective was not to open a subsidiary «but to open an office at eye level with Hamburg, with the same culture and with the best engineers».&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2014-11-01-absatzwirtschaft/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2014 19:05:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2014-11-01-absatzwirtschaft/</guid><description>&lt;p>Claudia Dietze speaks about the necessity of establishing detailed data of client behavior as a key to success but also respecting both privacy and informational self-determination.&lt;/p>

Meanwhile, many open source machine learning software libraries exist in order to experiment with deep artificial neural networks, i.e. TensorFlow or Torch. In his presentation “Machine Learning mit künstlichen neuronalen Netzwerken in Clojure” (“Machine Learning with Artificial Neural Networks in Clojure”), Stefan Richter shows us - during the fourth code.talks in 2014 - how exciting it is to build one&amp;rsquo;s own library for artificial neural networks in Clojure.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2014-06-06-wir_haben_eine_hackerkultur/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2014 13:58:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2014-06-06-wir_haben_eine_hackerkultur/</guid><description>&lt;p>Claudia Dietze speaks of the necessity of transferring standard business models into the digital world and, furthermore, about freiheit.com’s hacker culture. freiheit.com is one of 900.000 mid-sized business customers of Deutsche Bank.&lt;/p>

The project made freiheit.com an early adopter of HTML5, Clojure, cloud-based NoSQL database, and smartphone clients with offline syncing. In 2010, at one of the HackFwd Build Conferences on Mallorca, Stefan explains the technical architecture of the system.&lt;/p>

The outcome was a presentation at the LinuxTag about algorithms in Objective-C, with which Guile Scheme programs for GNU Robot could genetically be optimized.&lt;/p>
