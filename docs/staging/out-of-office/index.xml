Of course, they take the opportunity to join the Lisbon team’s activities – like playing a round of paddle on their most recent trip. Since opening our engineering hub in Lisbon in 2018, it has been particularly rewarding to foster the connection between the members of our two hubs.</description></item><item><title>Sports: Running, Biking, Bouldering, Soccer and More</title><link>https://freiheit.com/staging/out-of-office/sports/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/staging/out-of-office/sports/</guid><description>Sports: Running, Biking, Bouldering, Soccer and More If you can name a sport, there’s probably a freiheit.com member who likes it.

Since they take place on Friday nights, some members enjoy a drink afterwards in our lounge on the 6th floor with a view over the port of Hamburg.</description></item><item><title>Hash Code Coding Challenge</title><link>https://freiheit.com/staging/out-of-office/hash-code-coding-challenge/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/staging/out-of-office/hash-code-coding-challenge/</guid><description>Hash Code Coding Challenge Every year, freiheit.com members form teams to participate in Hash Code, Google’s annual team programming competition.
