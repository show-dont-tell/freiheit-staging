After just under five years, the system now generates over 4 billion euros per year and has become one of the largest Google Cloud&amp;nbsp;→ customers in Europe.</description></item><item><title>Site Reliability Engineering &amp; Infrastructure as Code</title><link>https://freiheit.com/staging/what-weve-build/site-reliability-engineering-infrastructure-as-code/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/staging/what-weve-build/site-reliability-engineering-infrastructure-as-code/</guid><description>We started to build our own site reliability engineering team in 2016.

Our music streaming, mobile office and notification applications are currently running in production in data centers around the world. Also we have built a new core app (and its cloud back-ends), which is the main app for all new owners of the recently launched electric cars.</description></item><item><title>AI, Data Science &amp; Machine Learning</title><link>https://freiheit.com/staging/what-weve-build/ai-data-science-machine-learning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/staging/what-weve-build/ai-data-science-machine-learning/</guid><description>In our view, AI is the application of machine learning to solve a problem that previously only humans were capable of solving. We have built several decision support systems that use machine learning. One example is an AI system that employs many machine learning models together to make medical experts 10x more productive.</description></item><item><title>Flight Booking Engines</title><link>https://freiheit.com/staging/what-weve-build/flight-booking-engines/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/staging/what-weve-build/flight-booking-engines/</guid><description>Way back in 1999, we were among the first to build travel and booking systems that connected the giant computer reservation systems (CRS) of Amadeus and Sabre to the internet. We were the first to show only the available flights, filtering out unhelpful unavailable flights, long before sites like Expedia even existed.</description></item><item><title>Online Bookstores</title><link>https://freiheit.com/staging/what-weve-build/online-bookstores/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/staging/what-weve-build/online-bookstores/</guid><description>We have been building many of the e-commerce platforms for the competitors of Amazon in the German and European book industry. Online bookstores were quite difficult to build in the times before the cloud, because they have staggeringly large assortments, often over 20 million individual articles, which change daily. That’s a lot of data to process! On top of that it is very satisfying to work for the “underdogs” and help them to compete with industry giants like Amazon.</description></item><item><title>Hyper-Scalable E-Commerce System</title><link>https://freiheit.com/staging/what-weve-build/hyper-scalable-e-commerce-system/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/staging/what-weve-build/hyper-scalable-e-commerce-system/</guid><description>We helped the coffee house and seasonal retailer Tchibo to revolutionize its multinational e-commerce website. Going from on-premises to Google Cloud Platform&amp;nbsp;→ relieved the company’s IT-professionals and made it possible to break down the system’s monolithic core into microservices. Our engineers integrated dozens of interfaces to legacy-backend systems with zero downtime of the shop, minimizing impact on customer service and business transactions.</description></item><item><title>Connected Cloud Services for Dentsply Sirona</title><link>https://freiheit.com/staging/what-weve-build/connected-cloud-services-dentsply-sirona/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/staging/what-weve-build/connected-cloud-services-dentsply-sirona/</guid><description>With one of the world’s largest manufacturers of professional dental products and technologies, we have built a cloud ecosystem that lets dentists collect and process 3D image data in the cloud right from their scanning device. The service enables real-time cloud collaboration between specialists and ordering 3D printed oral appliances with strict GDPR compliance. This first-of-its-kind solution not only gives our client a competitive advantage, but also streamlines healthcare services for millions of patients around the globe.</description></item><item><title>And There Is More</title><link>https://freiheit.com/staging/what-weve-build/and-there-is-more/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/staging/what-weve-build/and-there-is-more/</guid><description>We have built lottery platforms (business model: selling random numbers) and dating platforms (business model: selling contacts between customers). The internet is full of interesting new ideas and we are sure that this is still just the beginning.</description></item></channel></rss>
