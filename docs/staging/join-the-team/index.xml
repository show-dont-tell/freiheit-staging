In our Engineering Hubs in Hamburg and Lisbon you will meet people from all over the world, different cultures, colors, languages, genders and lifestyles. We celebrate diversity and openness.
When you ask anybody why they are working here, it is pretty likely that people will say “because of the people” and “because I have never learnt so much in my life”. Our company is a place to be yourself, aim high, taking care of each other and growing without limits.</description></item><item><title>85 % of our people are engineers.</title><link>https://freiheit.com/staging/join-the-team/85-of-our-people-are-engineers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/staging/join-the-team/85-of-our-people-are-engineers/</guid><description>85 % of Our People Are Engineers.
