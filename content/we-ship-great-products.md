### We Ship Great Products.

“Ship” means that we deliver. Fast and in daily increments. To achieve goals.

“Great” means that we are building scalable systems that can be used, extended and maintained for decades to come.

Most large-scale systems are in operation for over a decade and most of them even longer. Because they are important investments.
