In 2009 we built a new custom webshop for Tchibo, a leading coffee and consumer goods retailer in Europe with an annual turnover of €3 billion.

“Jede Woche eine neue Welt” – Tchibo’s unique concept required a webshop as dynamic as their vision. Their former standardized webshop solution couldn’t keep up with growing webshop sales at that time. So we rebuilt their whole system from scratch.

We committed the Go-Live date for the new webshop twelve months in advance – and delivered as planned and on time, on budget, on target.

The new webshop featured a tailor-made content management system and seamless scalability, ensuring smooth operations even on the busiest days – especially during peak holiday seasons. For over 16 years and ongoing, we made sure Tchibo’s operations were efficient and ensured a unique shopping experience for their customers even with upcoming demands.

In 2020 we moved Tchibo’s webshop to [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/customers/tchibo) and replaced its monolith architecture step by step with microservices.

When you build and maintain such a system over almost two decades at scale you learn a lot how to build systems that can stand the test of time. We added a lot of new features, rolled out to new countries and the traffic quadrupled over time. And still it is a solid system that our client can trust.

This is the practical software engineering knowledge that we teach to our new hires to forge well-rounded software engineers.
