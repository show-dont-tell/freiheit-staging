We helped the coffee house and seasonal retailer Tchibo to revolutionize its multinational e-commerce website. Going from on-premises to [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/customers/tchibo) relieved the company’s IT-professionals and made it possible to break down the system’s monolithic core into microservices.
