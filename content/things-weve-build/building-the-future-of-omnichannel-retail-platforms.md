freiheit.com enabled Peek & Cloppenburg Düsseldorf to create a seamless omnichannel platform using [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/customers/peek-cloppenburg). With 160 stores in 16 countries and multiple international online shops, Peek & Cloppenburg Düsseldorf fashion group sells high-grade fashion for all ages. Together with P&C, we built a scalable system for personalized shopping experiences based on customer interests and purchase history. The retail platform drives sales performance by connecting online and in-store shopping experiences.
To ensure that Peek & Cloppenburg Düsseldorf can seamlessly take over once the platform is live and operational, we supported the omnichannel project with several teams, from our lead engineering team that's doing most of the development, to integrated teams that include engineers from both organizations.
