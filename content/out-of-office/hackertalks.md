### Hackertalks

We are an engineering organization. 85% of our members are engineers with backgrounds in Computer Science, Physics or Mathematics, many also with strong machine learning backgrounds.
Of course we have a beautiful office in a very nice area of each city. But more important is that self-Improvement and learning are deeply ingrained into our company's DNA and in the personality of all of our team members. We tackle new and interesting problems all the time and very often create things that nobody has built before.

That’s why our freiheit.com engineers meet for Hackertalks every friday. Some members enjoy a drink afterwards in our community area on the 6th floor, overlooking the port of Hamburg. Each week, one member shares insights on current projects or discusses new technologies
The topics range from physics to the latest computer game technology. 

Keep an eye on our LinkedIn page → to join for a public hackertalk.
