### Hackertalks

We pride ourselves on the training and the personal development of our members. Thatâ€™s why this list wouldn't be complete without hackertalks, which of course take place during work hours. Every week, engineers at freiheit.com get together to share insights into projects, discover new technologies and discuss ideas. Since they take place on Friday nights, some members enjoy a drink afterwards in our lounge on the 6th floor with a view over the port of Hamburg. Keep an eye on our [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/freiheit-com-technologies) to join us for a public hackertalk!
