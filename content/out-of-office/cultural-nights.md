### Cultural Nights

To connect members from our different countries and cultures, we regularly host cultural nights with food and drinks from their native countries. At our most recent Portugal x Germany Cultural Night, we serve Portuguese past√©is de bacalhau and German pretzels. Our founders Claudia and Stefan make it a priority to join the fun and enjoy the evening with the team.
