### Cultural Nights

As a cosmopolitan community, a lot of our members are not native to Germany. We regularly host cultural nights with food and drinks from their native countries – whether it’s Syria, Slavic countries, USA, Turkey or Egypt. At our most recent Portugal x Germany Cultural Night, we served Portuguese pastéis de bacalhau and German pretzels.
