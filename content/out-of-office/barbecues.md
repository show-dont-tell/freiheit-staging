### Barbecues and Team Events in our Rooftop Lounge above St. Pauli

Above the roof of the vibrant neighborhood of St. Pauli in Hamburg, freiheit.com members come together in our Rooftop Lounge we call 6forward. Thatâ€™s where we host barbecues, celebrate Christmas or just casually hang out after work. For Easter 2022, the support team hosted a barbecue with meat, vegetarian/vegan and halal options, sides and cocktails for everyone.
