### Playing Paddle in Lisbon

Members from our engineering hub in Hamburg regularly visit the Lisbon team on business trips. Of course, they take the opportunity to join the Lisbon team’s activities – like playing a round of paddle on their most recent trip. Since opening our engineering hub in Lisbon in 2018, it has been particularly rewarding to foster the connection between the members of our two hubs.
