### Fun in Hamburg and Lisbon

Our members regularly travel between our engineering hubs in Hamburg and Lisbon – like the newbies from Lisbon who come to Hamburg for their first two weeks of onboarding to connect with our company culture. Obviously, they don’t just come to work. Having fun with colleagues and exploring Hamburg is always a popular part of the trip. Every year, the whole company meets for our Summer and Christmas Events.

Members from Hamburg who visit our engineering hub in Lisbon take the opportunity to join the Lisbon team’s activities – like playing a round of paddle on their most recent trip. Since opening our engineering hub in Lisbon in 2018, it has been particularly rewarding to foster the connection between the members of our two hubs.
