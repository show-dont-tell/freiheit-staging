Since freiheit.com was founded, we have built our own tools adopting early techniques of AI and Machine Learning, helping us to effectively and efficiently manage software projects: from early XMPP bots over prolog backend and Rete algorithm-based production systems for a rule-based expert system for task management written in Clojure. This even became a small startup project: “How a Clojure pet project turned into a full-blown cloud-computing web app”.
