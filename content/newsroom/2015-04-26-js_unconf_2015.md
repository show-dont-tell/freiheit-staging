JS Unconf is a non-profit conference of the JavaScript community. In 2015, freiheit.com is one of the sponsors. The audience has chosen our colleague Michael Bohn to speak about “Displaying, Animating, and Comunicating with Ponies in famo.us”. Michael is providing both his presentation and demo app on our GitHub account.
