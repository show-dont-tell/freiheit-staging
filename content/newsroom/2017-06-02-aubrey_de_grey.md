On June 2, 2017, we got an awesome guest speaker at our HackerTalk - [Aubrey de Grey](https://twitter.com/aubreydegrey?lang=de), the Chief Science Officer and Co-Founder of the [SENS Research Foundation](http://www.sens.org/). The foundation's stated goal is to transform the way the world researches and treats age-related disease. Aubrey provocatively proposes that the first human beings who will live to 1,000 years old have already been born.
