### We are one community.

Dunbarâ€™s number suggests that there is a limited amount of meaningful social connections we can maintain. Instead of growing beyond this number in Hamburg, we opened our second engineering hub in Lisbon in 2018.

Our engineering hub in Lisbon operates under the same organizational principles and team structures as our headquarters in Hamburg. Our teams work together seamlessly, sharing knowledge and expertise across borders.

Lisbon has a thriving tech scene, with many talented engineers who prefer to stay in Portugal rather than relocate to Hamburg. Our hub gives them the opportunity to join our ambitious community of software engineers. They tell the story of growing their community in this video.
