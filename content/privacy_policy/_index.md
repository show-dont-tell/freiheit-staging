Therefore, we would like to inform you comprehensively about which data we collect from you and for what purpose.

What are personal data?
All data that can be related to you personally, e.g. name, address, e-mail addresses, user behaviour.


## When do we process data and for what purpose?

### contact through you

When you contact us by e-mail, the data you provide will be stored by us in order to process your inquiry or request.
In doing so, we will at least receive your first and last name and your e-mail address.

We delete the data collected for the above-mentioned purpose after storage is no longer necessary or restrict processing if there are legal obligations to keep records.

The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) of the EU Basic Data Protection Regulation ("DSGVO").


### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics for statistical evaluation of the use of our website.
Details of how we use Google Analytics and how to disable Google Analytics are described below.

The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter f) DSGVO.


### No processing of server log data

It is important to us to process as little data as possible from you.
Unlike many of the other websites, we do not collect so-called server log files via your browser.
Server log files include, for example, the browser type and version, the operating system you use, the website from which you visit us (referrer URL), the date and time of access.


### No Cookies

With the exception of Google Analytics, this website does not use cookies.


### third party for video streaming

We use third-party services to display videos.
Currently these are [youtube.com](https://youtube.com) and [vimeo.com](https://vimeo.com).
These third parties may process data.
We do not collect this data and there is no exchange of data between freiheit.com and these third parties.
Please read the privacy policies of these third party providers and our notes below.


## Google Analytics

### basics

Our website uses Google Analytics from Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States of America ("Google").
Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site.
The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.

We have activated IP anonymisation on this website, therefore your IP address will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other states which are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before.
Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.
On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.
The IP address transmitted by your browser within the framework of Google Analytics is not combined with other data from Google.


### Google Analytics Browser Opt-Out

You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.
You can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de).


### IP anonymization

This website uses Google Analytics with the extension `_anonymizeIp()`.
This allows IP addresses to be further processed in a shortened form, thus excluding the possibility of personal references.
If the data collected about you contains a personal reference, this is immediately excluded and the data is therefore deleted immediately.


### purposes of data processing

We use Google Analytics to analyze and regularly improve the use of our website.
We can use the statistics obtained to improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user.
For the exceptional cases in which data is transferred to the USA, Google has subjected itself to the EU-US Privacy Shield, [https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework](https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework).

## Plugin Youtube

Videos on YouTube.com are integrated on our website.
This is a service provided by YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Avenue, San Bruno, CA 94066, USA, represented by Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("YouTube").
Normally, when you visit a website with embedded videos, your IP address is sent to YouTube and cookies are installed on your computer.

However, we have embedded our YouTube videos with the enhanced privacy mode (in this case, YouTube still contacts Google's Double Click service, but according to Google's privacy policy, personal data is not evaluated in this process).
As a result, YouTube no longer stores information about visitors unless they are watching the video.
When you click on the video, your IP address is sent to YouTube and YouTube learns that you have watched the video.
If you are logged in to YouTube, this information is also associated with your account (you can prevent this by logging out of YouTube before viewing the video).

We have no knowledge of and no influence on the processing of your data by YouTube.
For more information, please refer to the YouTube privacy policy at [https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy](https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy).

You can prevent YouTube from loading by changing your browser settings (deactivating JavaScript and iFrames).
Please refer to the instructions of your browser manufacturer for details of how this works.
For some browsers there are also add-ons that make it easier for you to make these settings, e.g. for Mozilla Firefox the script blocker "NoScript" [noscript.net](http://noscript.net) or the ad blocker "Adblock Plus" [adblockplus.org](https://adblockplus.org/de) in combination with the "EasyPrivacy" list [easylist.to](https://easylist.to).

## plugin Vimeo

Videos on Viemeo.com are included on our website.
This is a service of Vimeo, Inc. 555 West 18th Street, New York, New York 10011, USA ("Vimeo").
When you view videos through Vimeo, a connection is established to the Vimeo servers in the USA. This transfers certain information to Vimeo.
It is also possible that Vimeo may store cookies on your end device.
In addition, Vimeo allows you to use certain other functions, such as rating or sharing videos.
This may require you to log in to Vimeo or certain third parties (such as facebook or twitter) with your user account so that they can associate the information you submit with your account.

These features are provided exclusively by Vimeo and the third parties, and you should carefully review their privacy policies before using these features.

We are not aware of the content of the information collected by Vimeo or third parties and have no control over its use.
Through the integration, Vimeo may also receive information that your browser has called up the appropriate page on this website, even if you do not have a Vimeo account or are not currently logged in to Vimeo.

For more information about Vimeo's collection and use of your information and your rights, please refer to the Vimeo Privacy Policy at https://vimeo.com/privacy.

You can prevent Vimeo from loading by changing your browser settings (disabling JavaScript and iFrames).
Please refer to the instructions provided by your browser manufacturer for details of how this works.
For some browsers there are also add-ons that make it easier for you to make these settings, e.g. for Mozilla Firefox the script blocker "NoScript" [noscript.net](http://noscript.net) or the ad blocker "Adblock Plus" [adblockplus.org](https://adblockplus.org/de) in combination with the "EasyPrivacy" list [easylist.to](https://easylist.to).


## Third party {#Drittlandtransfer}

Data will only be transferred to third parties if you have given your explicit consent in advance or if we are contractually or legally entitled or obliged to do so, or if we are required to do so by court or official authorities.

## Third country transfer

The servers of some of the service providers we use are located in the USA and other countries outside the European Union or the European Economic Area ("Third Country").

Insofar as the data protection law applicable in the respective third country does not provide an adequate level of data protection in accordance with the DSGVO, we have ensured an adequate level of protection in accordance with the DSGVO by means of contractual regulations or other recognised instruments.
Insofar as data is transferred to third countries, this is done on the basis of the EU Commission's Adequacy Decision on the EU-US Privacy Shield or on the basis of the EU standard contractual clauses.

We would like to point out that your right to deletion may be restricted by legal retention periods.

### right of objection

Insofar as we base the processing of your data on the weighing of interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) DSGVO), you may object to the processing.
