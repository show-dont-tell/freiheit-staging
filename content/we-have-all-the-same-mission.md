### We all have the same mission.

It all started in a kitchen in 1999 with our two founders. Now we are 250+ people in Hamburg and Lisbon.

Both of our hubs operate under the same organizational principals and team structure. Our teams work together seamlessly, sharing knowledge and expertise across borders.

[We are one community](/our-community)

No matter how many of us there are. To our core, we have always stayed the same. Our mission remains:

Ship great software. Never late. Never failed.
