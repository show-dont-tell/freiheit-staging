### We all have the same mission.

It all started in a kitchen in 1999 with our two founders. Now we are 250+ people in Hamburg and Lisbon.

Both of our hubs operate under the same organizational principals and team structure. Our teams work together seamlessly, sharing knowledge and expertise across borders.

No matter how many of us there are. To our core, we have always stayed the same. Our mission remains:

Ship great software. Never late. Never failed.
