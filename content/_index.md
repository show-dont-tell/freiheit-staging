## We are pioneers.
freiheit.com technologies was founded in 1999, in the midst of the first internet boom.

Since then, we've been creating custom software platforms and helping them to create their future business models based on software.

Large-scale means: millions of users, queries, transactions and billions of revenue.

From e-commerce to connected cars. Retail, healthcare, mobility, logistics and many more industries. Cloud computing, microservices, artificial intelligence and machine learning platforms. Multi-country, multi-continental. Multi-data center.

## We Are Software Engineers

We see software development as an engineering discipline. We focus on simplicity, lean and iterative engineering - and fast delivery processes since our foundation and long before “agile” became a buzzword.

Good software engineering means “keeping it simple”. We are building the simplest “software machine” with as few parts, mechanisms and dependencies as possible.

Simple is not easy.

Becoming a well-rounded software engineer is a long journey that takes many years of hard work and learning. Technology never rests. And neither do we.

We are for engineers, by engineers.

Working at freiheit.com is an exciting adventure, with the goal to become a well-rounded software engineer who is able to plan, create and operate and lead large-scale systems in a team of software engineers.

## We are Reliable. This Creates Trust.

We truly delight in helping clients achieve incredible results.

We are known for our deep technical expertise and our track record of delivering successful software projects. In over two decades, we have never failed to deliver what we promised.

This is why our clients trust us with their most important projects. Most of our business comes from recommendations.

## We are Efficient, Productive and Successful

To be successful, you need to be productive. To be productive, you need to be efficient.

Our teams work data-driven and use metrics to constantly optimize efficiency and productivity.

We are using our own project management tool called Revolution. It was built to make it easy to supply our teams with all the data and metrics they need to get a clear picture of the current project status. And the teams use it to predict future project outcomes based on past progress.

## We Are Problem Solvers

We love taking on difficult and ambitious missions and solving challenging problems. We believe that nothing is impossible.

We combine a growth mindset with long-term thinking and a can-do attitude.

## We Ship Great Products

“Ship” means that we deliver. Fast and in daily increments. To achieve goals.

“Great” means that we are building scalable systems that can be used, extended and maintained for decades to come.

Most large-scale systems are in production for over a decade and most of them even longer. Because they are important investments.

## Collective Intelligence and Intelligent Collective

As engineers, we strive to distribute our knowledge and best practices to everyone within our company. Our goal is to make sure all team members "know what the company knows." This reduces our reliance on induvidual experts and also helps us avoid making the same mistakes twice.

To keep our expertise up to date, we have a lean and fast request for comments process, where all team members contribute to our knowledge base. This knowledge base is maintained by our various engineering task forces. They continuously publish fresh knowledge base updates for other teams to learn from and apply.

This process allows us to take full advantage of the collective intelligence of our people and creates a very mature engineering organization that still has the speed and determination of a start-up.

## We Are a Product Development Organization

Our teams develop strategically important products and we use the same organizational principles and team structures that were shaped and pioneered by successful Silicon Valley product companies like Google or Apple.

Our teams are deeply involved in the creation of the product, from the first idea to the final rollout and even continuing on with long-term product management.

## We Are a Global Team

Our headquarter is in Hamburg, Germany. In 2018, we opened an engineering hub in Lisbon. Our next goal was to open global satellite offices and be able to work from anywhere in the world.

Then came COVID-19.

In March 2020, we started to work from home. Thanks to our international office setup, we already had all the tools and processes we needed.

We have adapted well to working completely remotely and enjoy many of its benefits, but we are certain that we will eventually re-open our physical offices.

We will continue to maintain an office space, so that in the future we will be able to build the personal relationships and sense of community that come from working closely together.

However, we see a great value in remote work too, and we will continue to open up more opportunities for remote workers to join our teams.

We are pretty sure that the office of the future will look different than it did before COVID-19. It will probably look more like a club with teams doing intense creative work that needs personal interaction. Our vision for a post-COVID office is a place focused on human connection and belonging.
