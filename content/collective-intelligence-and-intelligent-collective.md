### Collective Intelligence and Intelligent Collective.

As engineers, we strive to distribute our knowledge and best practices to everyone within our company. Our goal is to make sure all team members "know what the company knows." This reduces our reliance on induvidual experts and also helps us avoid making the same mistakes twice.

To keep our expertise up to date, we have a lean and fast request for comments process, where all team members contribute to our knowledge base. This knowledge base is maintained by our various engineering task forces. They continuously publish fresh knowledge base updates for other teams to learn from and apply.

This process allows us to take full advantage of the collective intelligence of our people and creates a very mature engineering organization that still has the speed and determination of a start-up.
