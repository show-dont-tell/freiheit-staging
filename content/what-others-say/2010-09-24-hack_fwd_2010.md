Stefan Richter not only was a board member of HackFwd - a startup founded by Lars Hinrichs - but at the same time he also founded the startup project “TheDeadline”. The project made freiheit.com an early adopter of HTML5, Clojure, cloud-based NoSQL database, and smartphone clients with offline syncing. In 2010, at one of the HackFwd Build Conferences on Mallorca, Stefan explains the technical architecture of the system.
