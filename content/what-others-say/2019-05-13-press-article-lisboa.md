Hamburg/Lisbon, May 7, 2019 – The German software company freiheit.com announces the opening of a new office in Lisbon. Specialised in building large-scale software platforms, the internet pioneer works for the who-is-who of the European economy such as Mercedes Benz, Volkswagen, Engel & Völkers and METRO. The company is a partner of Google and has a team of 150 people of which 85 per cent are software engineers. The company’s name ‘freiheit’ means ‘freedom’ or ‘liberdade’ and expresses its mission – to take the freedom to create the future with its software. With the new office in Lisbon, freiheit.com will further extend its reach by investing in long-term excellence at Europe’s new tech hotspot. 

Claudia Dietze, Co-Founder and Managing Director of freiheit.com, explains: “From the start, we have shared a strong believe in free, open source software - long, before it became mainstream. It gives us the freedom to create the best software for building our future. So, we decided to name our company ‘freiheit’ which means ‘freedom’ or ‘liberdade’. We think, it is the perfect name - because freedom has always been our mission.” 

The credo of freiheit.com cites Alan Kay: “The best way to predict the future is to create it.” Following this credo, together with its clients, freiheit.com rapidly develops groundbreaking, digital products for leading market players. Across all projects, the company is focused on excellent, smart software as well as on data science and machine learning – from software for the connected cars of Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen through to large-scale platforms for B2B food delivery for METRO. 

Claudia Dietze says: “We have super smart, well educated people - some of the best engineers in Europe. They are very passionate about technology and love to write code. That’s why we rank among the best worldwide. In Lisbon, we look for engineers on eye level: the best of their peer group, such as the top 5 per cent of the leading universities. At freiheit.com, every engineer is primus inter pares.”

In November 2018, the new Lisbon office was set up by a German starter team at the co-working space LACS – close to the old town and directly at the waterfront of the Tagus. Here, the new Portuguese engineers are working hand-in-hand with the team in Germany – the same clients, the same software, the same commitment towards high-end quality. In the meantime, freiheit.com has agreed collaborations with Lisbon’s tech universities and has hired several Portuguese employees, all spending at least six weeks for onboarding in the freiheit.com office in Germany. 

Planning on further investments, Claudia Dietze stresses: “High-end quality, eager to learn and constant self-reinvention are key. Onboarding likeminded people will determine our growth in Lisbon” and she adds: “Lisbon offers us so much with its beauty, its inspiring atmosphere and the great people who welcomed us from the start. Here, we aim at long-term excellence with a team of the best engineers.”
