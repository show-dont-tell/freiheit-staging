Imagine the European Union builds its IT infrastructure based on free software. Imagine European member states trade information with the help of open standards and share their software. Imagine municipalities and city councils profit from decentralized and collaborative software based on free software licenses. Imagine Europeans are no longer forced to use proprietary software any longer. 

That is the goal of the https://fsfe.org/[FSFE,role="inline"]. The https://fsfe.org/community/events/2016/summit/frontpage.de.html[FSFE Summit,role="inline"] is the general assembly that unites FSFE members and supporters from all over Europe. 

As a long-term FSFE donor, freiheit.com is represented through its founder Stefan Richter. In his talk https://conf.qtcon.org/en/qtcon/public/events/475[Free software is now the default choice for the digital transformation,role="inline"], Stefan speaks about free software as a standardized option within all major digitalization projects and Internet companies and offers basic decision guidelines for entrepreneurs, which he gathers from twenty years of personal experience.
