In his talk - held on March 11, 2016 - our guest speaker Matthias Kirschner, President of the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), discusses the foundation’s activity, successes, and future plans. Since October 2003, bookzilla.de is operated by freiheit.com and is the world’s first online bookstore supporting free software. All proceeds are donated to FSFE by freiheit.com since 2004. The non-profit organization supports the distribution and advancement of open source programs for over 30 years. Till January 2016, freiheit.com was able to donate more than 118,000 euros through proceeds and other individual donations.
