On June 2, 2017, we got an awesome guest speaker at our HackerTalk - https://twitter.com/aubreydegrey?lang=de[Aubrey de Grey,role="inline"], the Chief Science Officer and Co-Founder of the http://www.sens.org/[SENS Research Foundation,role="inline"]. The foundation's stated goal is to transform the way the world researches and treats age-related disease. Aubrey provocatively proposes that the first human beings who will live to 1,000 years old have already been born.
