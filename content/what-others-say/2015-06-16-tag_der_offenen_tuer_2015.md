Open House @ freiheit.com. On June 19, 2015, we are inviting friends and family of our colleagues to freiheit.comâ€™s Open House, showing how exciting the work of a software engineer can be. After a tour through freiheit.com laboratories, we are inviting all of our guests to a summer BBQ  on our panoramic rooftop terrace, overlooking St. Pauli.
