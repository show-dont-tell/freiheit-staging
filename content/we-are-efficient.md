## We are efficient and successful.

Our teams work data-driven to constantly optimize their own productivity by removing friction from their work.

We have capable people on every level of our engineering organization.
Nothing that is of any value can be accomplished without dedication and hard work. This is why we give the best we can in any situation.

Technology never rests. And neither do we.

85% of our members are engineers with backgrounds in computer science, physics, mathematics. Many of them with a PhD.

We believe that only someone who truly understands what the teams are working on can coordinate between teams and make them efficient.

This is why we eliminate unnecessary management positions and put engineers in charge. We move fast and work in small and efficient teams. Everybody acts like an owner of their projects and takes end-to-end responsibility.

So we donâ€™t take anything lightly. We are relentless. But we do everything with love.
