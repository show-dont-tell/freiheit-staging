In this series we talk about our approach on how we have been successfully delivering large-scale software projects for over a quarter of a century. This starts with how we are structured as a company with our levels and roles, how we work data-driven and use metrics to improve our performance while we guarantee the highest software quality possible.


### EP01 | On Tacit Knowledge

What's the difference between tacit and explicit knowledge?

Explicit knowledge can be written down, codified, and shared with others.
Tacit knowledge, on the other hand, is often difficult to write down or codify.

We deeply believe that tacit knowledge is actually what makes projects successful. And the reason why still so many software projects fail is because tacit knowledge is hard to acquire and hard to transfer.

With our Masterclasses we want to communicate the tacit knowledge that we have acquired in the last four decades in the development of large-scale software systems.
