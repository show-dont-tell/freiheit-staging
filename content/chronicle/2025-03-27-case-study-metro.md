**Building a customer individual e-commerce platform**

METRO AG, the global wholesale giant, serves over 21 million professional customers in over 30 countries worldwide with a revenue of 31.3 B Euro in 2024 alone. Many of them are in the field of restaurants, hotels, caterers and kiosks. METRO is the backbone of the entire hospitality industry, helping them run their daily business. These businesses all over the world must be able to rely on METRO 100% every day.

Their customers place their orders weekly and get them delivered or pick them up directly at one of the 625 stores. Each order is hyper individualized down to the price, and changes constantly with the seasons.

In the past, customers placed their orders through many different channels, using fax, email, phone calls or METROs old webshop. A great number of their almost 90.000 employees worldwide would then review and register their orders in a separate system – with different webshop solutions in each METRO country.

To make this vision come to life, Dentsply Sirona was looking for a strong partner to help them build a solution that would bring all the dental applications safely into the cloud. This cloud platform, called DS Core, would allow dentists and laboratories to collaborate seamlessly with each other, making the workflow more efficient and the treatment span shorter for the patient.

{{< quote text="Our goal was to rapidly roll out into all 30 countries with 624 stores. This was simply not possible with an on-premise solution. Our large-scale business requires an incredibly fast and reliable infrastructure with automatic provisioning of additional infrastructure" source="Timo Salzsieder - Chief Executive Officer METRO, 2018" >}}

In the early 2010s, METRO realized it was time for a change. Their old e-commerce platform “fast order entry” faced challenges due to its inability to handle the complexity of B2B wholesale transactions, such as bulk orders, customized pricing, and seamless integration with logistics systems, leading to inefficiencies and customer dissatisfaction. To stay ahead of their competitors and keep up with the pace of online retail, their e-commerce platform had to be completely renewed to:
- Be globally available, scalable and flexible for the future of METRO
- Enable employees to manage and adjust every order within one system
- Offer a customized shopping experience for each customer
- Support the unique highly-individualized pricing model of METRO

The complexity of this e-commerce platform would be substantial, as it combined a number of dependencies and databases.
In late 2014, METRO found the right partner to build this B2B platform, freiheit.com. The software engineering company from Hamburg offered a new way of software engineering, reducing complexity on all levels. Together they defined a new approach that would lead the project to a fast roll-out and a scalable platform ready for any demand. They implemented a new microservices platform with React.js while pioneering Kubernetes back when it was still in its beta-phase. In only 12 months of development time, they built a platform with more than 200 services. From the first workshop to delivering the finished project, METRO and freiheit.com wrote over 5 billion lines of code. Together they set up a platform that brought METRO away from delivery cycles of several months to daily live deployments and moved from a monolithic architecture to microservices.
This system now generates over 4 billion euros per year and has become an essential part of METRO’s business. Bringing their webshop to a complete new level.
Nowadays, their clients can simply place their orders choosing from over 850.000 products (e.g. Germany), on the website and METRO employees can access and modify them through the push of a button.

Individualized. All in one place. Scalable and future-proof.

### Meet the Key Players

<br />

###### About METRO

METRO AG, commonly known as METRO, is a global wholesale company headquartered in Düsseldorf, Germany. It was founded in 1964 by Ernst Schmidt and Wilhelm Schmidt-Ruthenbeck, starting off as a cash-and-carry business, which is a retail business model in which customers select, pay for and take away (carry) the goods themselves. This was aimed at catering to professional customers such as restaurants, hotels, and independent retailers. Over the decades, METRO has expanded significantly, establishing a presence in over 30 countries and employing over 90.000 people worldwide. 

**A true German success story.**

Today, METRO focuses on its core wholesale and digital business solutions, particularly catering to the needs of the hospitality sector like HoReCa (Hotel, Restaurants and Catering) as well as their Trader Customers (kiosks and stores). The company offers their customers a combination of physical outlets and digital platforms. Through these initiatives, METRO continues to adapt to market demands, offering efficient, digital-focused solutions for modern businesses.

### From the MVP to an omnichannel vision

Let’s go back to the start
In 2014, METRO approached freiheit.com to develop a modern platform that would revolutionize their pre-ordering system. At the time, METRO was relying on a legacy system, MCRM (Metro Customer Relationship Management), introduced in 2009. This system had limited possibilities to add features, was difficult to use, and had long release cycles. It was simply not scalable for METRO’s growing omnichannel business. 
The initial goal was clear:
- Replace MCRM with a scalable and user-friendly platform that can offer both employees and customers direct order placement and tracking.

Historically, METRO’s process revolved around “fast order entry” where bulk buyers — primarily HoReCA (Hotels, Restaurants, Cafes) customers — placed orders through METRO employees, typically over the phone or via mail. This system lacked the possibility to be integrated with other METRO operations and therefore slowed down the order and delivery process.

The vision was more than just a simple replacement. METRO aimed for an omnichannel solution that eventually combined:
- Delivery services
- Online ordering
- Marketplace for regional suppliers
    - like wineries and cheese dairies especially in France.

This new platform would allow METRO to serve their diverse target audience and marked the beginning of the biggest modernization project in the history of METRO. Starting in 2015, together with freiheit.com, the project was to be rolled out in different stages. Beginning with connecting a first depot to the e-commerce platform in Germany and later expanding to include France's marketplace and eventually to the rest of Europe.

Dentists are one of the few medical professionals that diagnose their patients and also directly offer procedures  within the same facility. The dental industry is also one of the only ones that has successfully digitized its entire process, from diagnosis to finished dental product.

However, before DS Core was brought to life, the collaboration between dentists and laboratories was time consuming and complicated, meaning that each dental practice had its own hardware and software that wasn’t connected to each other. To place an order for a dental product, the dentist had to communicate with the laboratories using his own software as there was no platform to combine it all.

### Accomplishing milestones

<br />

###### One PoC, 3 engineers, 3 weeks, 3D rendering in GCP, seamless switch load/cloud

<br />

**It all started in 2021** with a small Proof of Concept organized by Dentsply Sirona. The company had embarked on a journey to find the right partner to create a cloud solution for dentists. The collaboration they were looking for would be long-term and in close partnership with the company.

Google recommended freiheit.com to Dentsply Sirona during the PoC. freiheit.com joined this process only **3 weeks before final submission**. This PoC included three different challenges:

- Sharing
- Uploading
- 3D Rendering of data in the cloud

freiheit.com selected the most challenging one, the 3D Rendering.

In only 3 weeks and with a small team of 3 engineers, freiheit.com accomplished a Proof of Concept for a software that enables dentists to stream 3D renderings in the cloud and edit them directly in the browser.

<br />

###### The advantages:

- 3D renderings could immediately be accessed by any dentist and collaborating laboratories.
- Rendering in the cloud minimizes the hardware dependency, creating flexibility for the end-user.

Fast implementation of new dental applications due to the flexibility of updating directly in the cloud.

###### Deep Dive

### 3D rendering in the cloud

The initial proof-of-concept aimed to demonstrate the technical feasibility of cloud-based 3D rendering in a time- and cost-effective manner.

freiheit.com paired with the experts from Dentsply Sirona to migrate a desktop 3D render engine to the cloud.

The render engine used in the PoC version for DS Core lacked headless rendering support, prompting freiheit.com to devise a solution utilizing the render engine within a background X11 desktop environment. Rendered frames were captured as screenshots, compressed, and transmitted via websockets.

For the production version, the focus shifted to balancing user experience with resource optimization. freiheit.com transitioned from the X11 solution to a render engine version that supported background rendering. Additionally, freiheit.com implemented WebRTC streaming for real-time frame delivery and video codec compression for further data reduction. This minimized data transfer and ensured smooth playback, even for complex scenes.

Furthermore, to optimize resource utilization, the team employed GPU timesharing, enabling concurrent rendering sessions on a single GPU. freiheit.com also incorporated intelligent scaling mechanisms that dynamically adjust resource allocation based on anticipated usage patterns.

**The team** that worked on the DS Core was a symbiosis of **Fullstack Software Engineers** coming together to create something that had not been done before. They started with a team of 3, later becoming up to 30 engineers. Early on, they decided in agreement with Dentsply Sirona, to use Flutter/Dart as their technology as it is suitable for adaptable development and could be used for a mobile application if that's needed in the future.

###### Deep Dive

### A detailed look at Dart/Flutter

Flutter is a framework for the language Dart to build smooth and native-compiled apps for mobile, web and desktop.

Unlike Javascript, Flutter/Dart uses Ahead-of-Time compilation which leads to superior performance and faster loading times. Moreover Flutter uses the CanvasKit for Native-like Rendering that bypasses the DOM, enabling direct manipulation of the canvas for pixel-perfect rendering and smooth animations, achieving a native-like look and feel on the web.

Flutter’s mantra "Everything's a Widget", the tooling support, as well as ability to iterate fast, using hot reload make it a very pleasant developer experience as well.

All of these features, but also the benefit of having the possibility to use a single codebase to create the application for all platforms made Flutter/Dart a perfect match for the project.

### Release of the first Early-Market version of DS Core

7 months later

<br />

**The Closed Alpha**, which was already released **after 7 months**, is an extension of the results gained from the Proof of Concept. The early market version not only had the capability to visualize 3D data like the Proof of Concept (PoC) version, but it was also integrated into a platform offering various other features. The most important addition was the extension to store and share patient data directly in the cloud, allowing access to the data from anywhere. It was now also possible to automatically synchronize on-premise XRay scans from the dental practice into DS Core.

###### Deep Dive

### Implementing DS Core in 21 countries

DS Core leverages eight geographically distributed environments hosted across two hyperscalers: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Alibaba Cloud (Alibaba). These eight clusters strategically placed across the globe, cater to the specific data residency needs of the 21 countries where DS Core operates (spanning Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Australia).

To manage the infrastructure complexity of these eight clusters and ensure consistency across them, the infrastructure was utilized as code (IaC) and abstracts cloud provider-specifics. Furthermore, GitOps principles are employed to manage the Git repository containing application manifests, enabling full traceability and version control. The CI/CD scan automates the rollout process across all eight environments.

Despite this multi-cloud, multi-regional complexity, DS Core maintains agility through a robust CI/CD pipeline with integration and smoke testing. Proactive monitoring of both infrastructure and application health is achieved through Datadog, while using a feature toggle API, that empowers management of feature rollouts and mitigates risks. This combination of automation, version control, and monitoring allows for frequent deployments while maintaining a stable and secure infrastructure for DS Core.

### Taking a look into the future

**DS Core** is well on its way to becoming the **most important tool** for all dentists, laboratories and patients worldwide. New features are continuously added to the cloud platform and it is already available on 5 continents and in 21 countries. Efficient workflows - all in one platform, accessible from everywhere and at any time. **So dentists can focus on what's most important - the well-being of their patients.**
