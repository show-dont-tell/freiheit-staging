We are a software engineering company - by engineers for engineers. How are we successfully delivering large-scale projects to our clients always on time, on budget, on target and on quality?  To deliver the right product, we need to understand the client’s needs, establish the project scope and define the right features. We always ensure that we maintain uniformity and simplicity within the code base throughout the project. 

Who is responsible for that? The Product Engineering Leads and Systems Engineering Leads.

These aren’t managers. freiheit.com members that take on these roles started out like every newbie, as associate engineers. They developed their skills through different engineering levels over time. Eventually they became team leads and then took on overarching responsibilities of entire projects, so they know first hand how we work at freiheit.com.

We believe that only someone who truly understands what the teams are working on can coordinate between these teams and make them efficient. That’s what software engineering is all about.
