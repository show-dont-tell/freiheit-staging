September was special for our Lisbon engineering hub â€” it was our first-ever beach Summer Event. We had an amazing time surfing, playing beach volleyball and having great talks about technology and engineering.
It was all about having good discussions, lots of fun and creating new memories.

Our Lisbon hub has come a long way since its start in 2018 when our
co-founder Claudia Dietze made her dream come true by opening a second hub for freiheit.com technologies.
From the start, it was important to grow the hub with the same engineering spirit as in Hamburg â€” built for engineers by engineers.

Right now, the Lisbon hub has multiple engineering teams who are leading the way on several of the largest and most exciting software engineering projects around Europe.

This is just the beginning! As more and more new members join, events like these help us connect, share stories and strengthen our engineering hub.

Thanks to our fantastic team for making the Lisbon hub so special & successful! ðŸš€
