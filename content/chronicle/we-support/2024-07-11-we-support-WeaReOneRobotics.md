Becoming a well-rounded software engineer is a long journey that takes years of hard work and learning.

Many of our freiheit.com technologies engineers found their passion for software-engineering when they were young. Our Co-Founder and Head of Engineering Stefan Richter wrote his first computer program in 1983.

Thatâ€™s why we at freiheit.com technologies think it is important to invest in the future of software-engineering and decided to support We aRe oNe Robotics with a monetary donation.
They are a German non-profit organization dedicated to teaching children between the ages 9-16 about science and technology - and especially about robotics.

Since We aRe oNe Robotics was founded in 2009, they have taken part in numerous competitions like the [First Lego League](https://www.first-lego-league.org/en/) and the [World Robot Olympiad](https://www.worldrobotolympiad.de/) by TECHNIK BEGEISTERT e.V.

We love this.
