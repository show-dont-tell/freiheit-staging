We decided to support Formula Student Portugal because we want to encourage future software engineers in their passion to gain technical knowledge.

Formula Student is the biggest university engineering competition in the world. In the 1980s the project originated as an educational concept with the goal to nurture engineering talent. It evolved from being a Society of Automotive Engineers’ student competition to being an international contest with diverse teams of universities from all over the world participating. Formula Student Portugal is a new event for the Formula Student community in Portugal.

Participating student teams design, build, and race their own formula-style cars. But it’s not only a test of speed. It is rather a multifaceted engineering challenge with technical, creativity and teamwork aspects. The students have the opportunity to apply classroom theories in real-world scenarios fostering innovation in automotive engineering.

This competition is not only about building practical hard- and software engineering skills but also practice management, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities – everything that is essential for future industry leaders.
