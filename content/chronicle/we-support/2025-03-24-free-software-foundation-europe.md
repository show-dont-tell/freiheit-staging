Since 2003, we have supported free software with many donations through our project, bookzilla.de – making it the world’s first online bookstore dedicated to free software. All our proceeds are donated to the Free Software Foundation Europe.

Our long time friend Matthias Kirschner, the president of the Free Software Foundation Europe visited us last week to talk about their current projects.

The Free Software Foundation Europe helps individuals and organizations to understand how free software contributes to freedom, transparency and self-determination.

A big thanks to Matthias and his team.

They are shaping the future of software every day – we love this.
