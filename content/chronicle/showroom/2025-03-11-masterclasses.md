In this series we talk about our approach on how we have been successfully delivering large-scale software projects for over a quarter of a century. This starts with how we are structured as a company with our levels and roles, how we work data-driven and use metrics to improve our performance while we guarantee the highest software quality possible.


### EP01 | On Tacit Knowledge

What's the difference between tacit and explicit knowledge?

Explicit knowledge can be written down, codified, and shared with others.
Tacit knowledge, on the other hand, is often difficult to write down or codify.

We deeply believe that tacit knowledge is actually what makes projects successful.

With our Masterclasses we want to communicate the tacit knowledge that we have acquired in the last four decades in the development of large-scale software systems.

### EP02 | On Performance

What is a high-performance organization?

In order to become a high-performance organization, you have to optimize effectiveness, efficiency and quality.

Watch our Masterclass “On Performance" to learn how we do that.

### EP03 | On Software Quality

How do you measure code quality?

Actually you can’t. Code metrics can only measure if code is complex or not but they can’t tell us if the code is good or bad.

But how can you still make sure to deliver high quality in software?

Watch our Masterclass episode “On Software Quality" to learn how we do that since 1999.

### EP04 | On Effectiveness

What does it mean to be effective?

Effectiveness is about WHAT we do. This means we are effective if we work on the right things.

The most important thing is to have an ambitious goal.

How to get from an ambitious goal to a successful delivery?

Watch our Masterclass episode “On Effectiveness" here.

### EP05 | On Efficiency

What does it mean to be efficient?

Efficiency is about HOW we do things.
The ability to do something without wasting materials, time, or energy.

To become more efficient in software engineering we have to find out where we are wasting time and how to find and remove frictions.

Welcome to our Masterclass “On Efficiency".

### EP06 | On Experience

How do we teach people to become experienced software engineers?

We see ourselves like a university that forges well-rounded software engineers.

Each work assignment is like an exam that makes you a little bit better. Each engineering level is like the next semester in your education.

Watch here – in our Masterclass “On Experience" – how we develop people through our engineering levels.
