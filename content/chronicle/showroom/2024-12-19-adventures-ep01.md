“We are not leaving until this is fixed, that was clear without communication.”

On a Wednesday in October of 2019 our Product Engineering Lead, Omar, had his first Go-Live at freiheit.com. The day before he and his colleague found a bug – that no one else had noticed and that they didn’t even cause.

Our team knew that they wouldn't leave without fixing it.

“And this is when I felt, yes, this is what I want to do...”

In the first episode of our newest series “freiheit.com adventures”, Omar tells the story about how he knew that he was in the right place.
