Why are we successful?

There is one thing that brings us all together. The willingness to tackle new and interesting problems all the time. And successfully delivering them.

Becoming a well-rounded software engineer is a long journey that takes many years of hard work and learning.

When starting at freiheit.com, you are responsible for the smallest scope of work. From that on you gather experiences, learn from it and prove that you can reliably and independently handle the responsibilities of a certain level.
When we put together a team, we need different skill levels.
Our members pass through many different levels, from starting as a newbie, becoming a team lead and eventually being in charge of multiple teams.

This creates an organization where we have capable people on each level.
We celebrate not only milestones like a level-up, but also accomplishments like finishing your first week as a newbie or delivering a two year project. And everything in between.

That is why weâ€™ve created the Kudos System.

To appreciate something a member did for the team, the company, or the community. We use it to thank other members for a great code review, a great technical idea, great UX, hard work or any other accomplishments.

This is visible to the freiheit.com community, written by our members for our members - for everyone to see.

It is not obvious at first, but to become a better engineer you must be able to influence the work of other engineers.
