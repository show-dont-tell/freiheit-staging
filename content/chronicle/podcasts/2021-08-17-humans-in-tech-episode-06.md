After studying logistics & e-business in Remagen and playing bass in jazz clubs at night for a living, Sascha became a management consultant after he earned his first product management chops in the telco industry. Then he became a founding member of the product team at MOIA and launched this new kind of mobility service in Hamburg in 2019. He will share a good amount of war stories from this amazing journey.
