**Dentsply Sirona had a vision.** To make the workflow of dental practices around the world efficient, fast and seamless. To give dentists time to focus on what’s really important, the well-being of the patients.

###### Available worldwide. For 100.000+ dentists. With millions of dental procedures every day.

To make this vision come to life, Dentsply Sirona was looking for a strong partner to help them build a solution that would bring all the dental applications safely into the cloud. This cloud platform, called DS Core, would allow dentists and laboratories to collaborate seamlessly with each other, making the workflow more efficient and the treatment span shorter for the patient.

{{< quote text="At Dentsply Sirona we’ve been providing solutions for the dental industry for over three decades. These softwares grew continuously, piling many lines of code that demanded a lot of maintenance (...). We realized that it was time for a change and that we had to improve efficiency and unify the process to create a better workflow for dentists and laboratories. We needed a solution that moved everything natively into the cloud. This is where freiheit.com came in." source="Manfred Müller  - VP Software Engineering & UX - Dentsply Sirona" >}}

In collaboration with Dentsply Sirona, one of the **world’s largest manufacturers of professional dental products and technologies**, the software engineering company freiheit.com built an all-in-one platform that enables dentists and laboratories to upload, visualize, share and store patient data directly in the cloud. This platform does what was unthinkable before, it gives professionals in the dental sector the opportunity to handle almost all of their work within one place.

Before the platform was built, all communication and collaboration between dentists and laboratories was neither unified nor in one place.

### Unfolding the process

<br />

###### Defining the problem

With an ongoing **global digitalisation** across all industries, Dentsply Sirona was the first to take the next step within their industry. The entire dental sector relied heavily on on-premise IT systems in clinics and laboratories. This made it very difficult to update the software and systems, creating a **high hardware dependency** and making the interaction and collaboration between parties challenging. To solve these issues in a data secure way, Dentsply Sirona decided to transition its ecosystems into a new cloud architecture using Google Cloud. This would provide an **end-to-end digital experience**, so that one day, dentists will only need access to a browser.

<br />

###### The challenge

To bring the vision of DS Core to life, Dentsply Sirona and freiheit.com defined the following challenges:

- Secure **real-time data sharing** between dentists and laboratories.
- Smooth **3D rendering** experience of intraoral scans in a cost-effective manner.
- Connection of legacy systems to the cloud to enable **seamless workflows** as well as a transition phase.
- Integration of all data and systems on a secure clinical cloud sharing platform. Building a platform that allows a continuous addition of clinical applications for different devices to **DS Core** starting with:
  - Intraoral scanning
  - Dental milling
  - 3D Printing of dental products

<br />

###### Solving the puzzle

- Having a secured global cloud platform to connect dentists and laboratories.
- The cloud rendering engine performs the resource intensive computations in the cloud by leveraging Google Cloud’s support for high end graphic cards.
- The result is streamed via WebRTC to the browser of the user and allows for real time interaction

### Meeting the key players

Before going into depth about the roll-out of the collaboration between Dentsply Sirona and freiheit.com, it is of essence to take a look at the two companies that came together to build something revolutionary.

<br />

###### About Dentsply Sirona

{{< /full-width >}}

Dentists are one of the few medical professionals that diagnose their patients and also directly offer procedures  within the same facility. The dental industry is also one of the only ones that has successfully digitized its entire process, from diagnosis to finished dental product.

However, before DS Core was brought to life, the collaboration between dentists and laboratories was time consuming and complicated, meaning that each dental practice had its own hardware and software that wasn’t connected to each other. To place an order for a dental product, the dentist had to communicate with the laboratories using his own software as there was no platform to combine it all.

### Accomplishing milestones

<br />

###### One PoC, 3 engineers, 3 weeks, 3D rendering in GCP, seamless switch load/cloud

<br />

**It all started in 2021** with a small Proof of Concept organized by Dentsply Sirona. The company had embarked on a journey to find the right partner to create a cloud solution for dentists. The collaboration they were looking for would be long-term and in close partnership with the company.

Google recommended freiheit.com to Dentsply Sirona during the PoC. freiheit.com joined this process only **3 weeks before final submission**. This PoC included three different challenges:

- Sharing
- Uploading
- 3D Rendering of data in the cloud

freiheit.com selected the most challenging one, the 3D Rendering.

In only 3 weeks and with a small team of 3 engineers, freiheit.com accomplished a Proof of Concept for a software that enables dentists to stream 3D renderings in the cloud and edit them directly in the browser.

<br />

###### The advantages:

- 3D renderings could immediately be accessed by any dentist and collaborating laboratories.
- Rendering in the cloud minimizes the hardware dependency, creating flexibility for the end-user.

Fast implementation of new dental applications due to the flexibility of updating directly in the cloud.

<br />

###### Deep Dive

### 3D rendering in the cloud

The initial proof-of-concept aimed to demonstrate the technical feasibility of cloud-based 3D rendering in a time- and cost-effective manner.

freiheit.com paired with the experts from Dentsply Sirona to migrate a desktop 3D render engine to the cloud.

The render engine used in the PoC version for DS Core lacked headless rendering support, prompting freiheit.com to devise a solution utilizing the render engine within a background X11 desktop environment. Rendered frames were captured as screenshots, compressed, and transmitted via websockets.

For the production version, the focus shifted to balancing user experience with resource optimization. freiheit.com transitioned from the X11 solution to a render engine version that supported background rendering. Additionally, freiheit.com implemented WebRTC streaming for real-time frame delivery and video codec compression for further data reduction. This minimized data transfer and ensured smooth playback, even for complex scenes.

Furthermore, to optimize resource utilization, the team employed GPU timesharing, enabling concurrent rendering sessions on a single GPU. freiheit.com also incorporated intelligent scaling mechanisms that dynamically adjust resource allocation based on anticipated usage patterns.

**The team** that worked on the DS Core was a symbiosis of **Fullstack Software Engineers** coming together to create something that had not been done before. They started with a team of 3, later becoming up to 30 engineers. Early on, they decided in agreement with Dentsply Sirona, to use Flutter/Dart as their technology as it is suitable for adaptable development and could be used for a mobile application if that's needed in the future.

{{< quote text="The initial development was mainly managed by freiheit alone until we reached the first Alpha Release of DS Core. We then gradually broadened the teams that worked on that platform." source="Manfred Müller  - VP Software Engineering & UX - Dentsply Sirona" >}}

###### Deep Dive

### A detailed look at Dart/Flutter

Flutter is a framework for the language Dart to build smooth and native-compiled apps for mobile, web and desktop.

Unlike Javascript, Flutter/Dart uses Ahead-of-Time compilation which leads to superior performance and faster loading times. Moreover Flutter uses the CanvasKit for Native-like Rendering that bypasses the DOM, enabling direct manipulation of the canvas for pixel-perfect rendering and smooth animations, achieving a native-like look and feel on the web.

Flutter’s mantra "Everything's a Widget", the tooling support, as well as ability to iterate fast, using hot reload make it a very pleasant developer experience as well.

All of these features, but also the benefit of having the possibility to use a single codebase to create the application for all platforms made Flutter/Dart a perfect match for the project.

### Release of the first Early-Market version of DS Core

7 months later

<br />

**The Closed Alpha**, which was already released **after 7 months**, is an extension of the results gained from the Proof of Concept. The early market version not only had the capability to visualize 3D data like the Proof of Concept (PoC) version, but it was also integrated into a platform offering various other features. The most important addition was the extension to store and share patient data directly in the cloud, allowing access to the data from anywhere. It was now also possible to automatically synchronize on-premise XRay scans from the dental practice into DS Core.

###### Deep Dive

### Implementing DS Core in 21 countries

DS Core leverages eight geographically distributed environments hosted across two hyperscalers: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Alibaba Cloud (Alibaba). These eight clusters strategically placed across the globe, cater to the specific data residency needs of the 21 countries where DS Core operates (spanning Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Australia).

To manage the infrastructure complexity of these eight clusters and ensure consistency across them, the infrastructure was utilized as code (IaC) and abstracts cloud provider-specifics. Furthermore, GitOps principles are employed to manage the Git repository containing application manifests, enabling full traceability and version control. The CI/CD scan automates the rollout process across all eight environments.

Despite this multi-cloud, multi-regional complexity, DS Core maintains agility through a robust CI/CD pipeline with integration and smoke testing. Proactive monitoring of both infrastructure and application health is achieved through Datadog, while using a feature toggle API, that empowers management of feature rollouts and mitigates risks. This combination of automation, version control, and monitoring allows for frequent deployments while maintaining a stable and secure infrastructure for DS Core.

### Taking a look into the future

**DS Core** is well on its way to becoming the **most important tool** for all dentists, laboratories and patients worldwide. New features are continuously added to the cloud platform and it is already available on 5 continents and in 21 countries. Efficient workflows - all in one platform, accessible from everywhere and at any time. **So dentists can focus on what's most important - the well-being of their patients.**
