At freiheit.com we hire only top ranking students. But we know that performance is not only built on skills that are visible to us, that we learned and trained, like coding skills. Instead, performance also builds on hidden qualities that tell us how we show up when things get hard, in situations of stress, challenge or uncertainty. We call them Attributes. They are inherent to our nature and therefore harder but not impossible to develop.Weâ€™ve created a video series about them. Take a look.
