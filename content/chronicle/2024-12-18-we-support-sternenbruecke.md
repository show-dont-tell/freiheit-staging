Every year around the holidays, our community comes together to support a cause close to our hearts, the Sternenbrücke from Hamburg. The children's hospice Sternenbrücke provides respite care for terminally ill children and affected families. Even after the loss of the child, the Sternenbrücke continues to support the families in their grief.

We have been supporting the Sternenbrücke since 2016.
