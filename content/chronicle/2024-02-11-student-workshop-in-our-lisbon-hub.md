We are a software engineering company built for engineers by engineers.

We regularly open our doors to give students with different technical backgrounds the opportunity to learn how we plan, create, operate, and lead large-scale software systems. These workshops also serve as an opportunity for aspiring software-engineers to learn new programming skills and to meet our freiheit.com engineering teams. Each workshop focuses on a different programming language or topic. Last month, our students learned about external APIs and building API services based on them.

Becoming a well-rounded software engineer is a long journey that takes many years of hard work and learning.
