We have been supporting free software since 2003 with many donations and our donation project bookzilla.de. Since October 2003, bookzilla.de has been operated by freiheit.com and is the world’s first online bookstore supporting free software. All proceeds are donated to FSFE by freiheit.com.

Our long time friend @Matthias Kirschner, the president of the Free Software Foundation Europe visited us last week to talk about their current projects.

The Free Software Foundation Europe helps individuals and organizations to understand how Free Software contributes to freedom, transparency and self-determination.

A big thanks to Matthias and his team.

They are shaping the future of software every day – we love this.
