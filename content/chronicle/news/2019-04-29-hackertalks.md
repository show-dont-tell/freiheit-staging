Our Talks cover a large variety
of topics, such as learnings from our projects, research colleagues
did in their academic work, interesting pet projects, experiences with
new technologies, and disruptive ideas. The talks are usually
presented by colleagues, but we also frequently welcome guest speakers
from diverse areas of expertise, successful startup founders, renowned
scientists and open source activists.

Unless the talks cover internal details of a customer project, they're
open to the public and we would be happy to see you there!

Just make sure to register with our office to let us know in advance:
