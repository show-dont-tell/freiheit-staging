This years motto: it’s all about California 🎉
Our founders Claudia Dietze and Stefan Richter fell in love with California a long time ago and like to bring the spirit back to Germany. 🌴

Events like this are always a good occasion for all of us to get to know each other more, for senior members to meet the newbies and for everyone to enjoy time and talk about old stories. And of course to dance the night away together.

Whether someone has been with freiheit.com for 25 years or for 3 months, we all come together and celebrate.

Cheers to the best community <3

If you want to get a glimpse of the fun we had, take a look at this video we took to capture the spirit. 🏄
