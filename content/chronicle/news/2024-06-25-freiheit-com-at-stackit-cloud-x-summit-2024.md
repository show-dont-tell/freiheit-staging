STACKIT is developing an entire German business cloud. freiheit.com works for and with the Schwarz IT on various internal software products and is also involved in the development of the STACKIT platform. This is a gigantic task.
How can software engineering be made more effective, efficient and successful?


We at freiheit.com believe it's through data-driven software engineering.
