Our co-founder Claudia Dietze has always dreamed of taking freiheit.com international. In 2018, we opened a second engineering hub in Lisbon.

freiheit.com has always been for engineers by engineers, so to organize this big step, Claudia didn’t want to hire managers but chose freiheit.com engineers who embody our values and who would be able to transport them to a new hub. This is not easy – suddenly, these engineers had to take on a new role and build up a new engineering hub from scratch. And they did it!

Once the core values of freiheit.com were established in Lisbon, the focus changed to adapting these values to Portuguese culture and growing the Lisbon hub to the same eye level as the Hamburg hub.

To achieve this, the Gama team was founded. Vasco da Gama is to Portugal what the members of our Gama Team are to freiheit.com. They are building and shaping the future of freiheit.com in Portugal.

The engineering hub in Lisbon holds the same importance as our hub in Hamburg. We always wanted it to be the same eye level. Now we see they might even grow into a bigger hub than Hamburg. They really can be proud of themselves.

Because of Claudia and the whole Gama Team's commitment and dedication, our hub in Portugal is continuously growing while maintaining our freiheit.com mindset. As always, for engineers by engineers.

Kudos to them for making freiheit.com successful in Lisbon!
