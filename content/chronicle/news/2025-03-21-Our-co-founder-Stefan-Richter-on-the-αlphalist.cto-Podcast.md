{{< quote text="Our mission is to ship great software. Great software is actually simple, has as few dependencies as possible, as few parts as possible, like any good machine." source="Stefan Richter, Founder & Head of Engineering at freiheit.com" >}}

freiheit.com is an engineering organization for engineers by engineers.
This means we always concentrate on engineering. 85% of our members are software engineers with backgrounds in computer science, physics and mathematics, many also with a strong background in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

We don’t hire managers, we put engineers in charge, who build our software projects end-to-end.

Since 1999 we have been building hundreds of large-scale software projects helping our clients to create their future business models based on software.
We deliver all our projects on time, on budget, on target and on quality.

To be successful you need to put the right people into the right seats. And that starts with the right hiring process.

Stefan Richter talked to Tobias Schlottke in the αlphalist.cto podcast to discuss how we at freiheit.com have established a high bar hiring process.
