It all started in a kitchen in 1999 in Hamburg with our two founders Claudia Dietze and Stefan Richter – now we are 250+ people in Hamburg and Lisbon. And we still share the same vision and spirit – the can-do, won’t stop attitude.

We started with our first client, a big German car company and one small team back then. In the following 25+ years we successfully delivered hundreds of large-scale software projects. Now we at freiheit.com are working on some of the largest software projects in the world.

Each of our 250+ members plays an important role, ensuring we always deliver what we promised. We believe that teams work more efficiently and collaborate better if they are together in the office. That’s why it is important to us to always maintain an optimal work environment. In the end, it is where you spend the most part of your day.

This year we added a new floor in our Hamburg Office in Sankt Pauli – in our best pirate manner, we entered the new floor and celebrated the opening with beer, rum and fish sandwiches. Just like true pirates would do it.

In 2024 we also added a new area in our hub in the heart of Lisbon.
But no matter how many of us there are. To our core, we have always stayed the same. Our mission remains: Ship great software. Never late. Never failed.
