The slideshow in the series “Chefbüro” of the German magazine “WirtschaftsWoche” (14/2016), offers us a glimpse into the offices of the best managers. Throughout the three open-spaced, modern floors of the software company freiheit.com, located in the vibrant borough St. Pauli, Claudia shows how freiheit.com’s hacker culture comes to life in the office: “German Engineering meets Silicon Valley”. The mechanical model ship displayed on Claudia’s sideboard is a gift given to her by the late NASA pioneer Prof. Dr. Jesco Freiherr von Puttkamer. It perfectly displays how both worlds of “future and tradition” can go hand in hand. “The best way to predict the future is to invent it.” (Alan Kay)
