As software engineers, we at freiheit.com technologies aim to ensure everyone “knows what the company knows,” sharing 25+ years of expertise across our teams and clients. Our lean Request for Comments process keeps our Knowledge Base up to date, with thousands of articles added. To make knowledge easier to access, we’ve implemented AI using Google Cloud, allowing teams to find the right information at the right time.

Knowledge sharing is key for us at freiheit.com as we tackle complex, large-scale software projects. This helps reduce reliance on individual experts and prevent repeated mistakes.

Recently, we shared how we use AI for Knowledge Management at a hands-on workshop with Healthcare and Life Science experts at the Google offices in Zurich. Demonstrating how to build similar systems using Vertex AI for semantic search.

Google also invited Dentsply Sirona, the largest manufacturer of professional dental products and technology, who partnered with us for one of our success projects in the healthcare industry.

Together with Manfred Müller, Vice President at Dentsply Sirona, we talked about our journey from the first PoC to bringing their services to the cloud and empowering dentists to go digital within eight months. A successful project powered by data-driven software engineering and AI-enhanced Knowledge Management.

Via the all-in-one platform dentists and laboratories can now upload, visualize, share and store patient data like 3D renderings directly in the cloud. This makes the workflow of dental practices around the world efficient, fast and seamless.

Thanks to all who participated and organized this Daniel Fritsch, Janaina Poeta Frey and Samuel Kruklis – we loved connecting and discussing tech with all of you!

Technology never rests. And neither do we.
