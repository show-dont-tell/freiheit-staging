**Dentsply Sirona had a vision.** To make the workflow of dental practices around the world efficient, fast and seamless. To give dentists time to focus on what’s really important, the well-being of the patients.

###### Available worldwide. For 100.000+ dentists. With millions of dental procedures every day.

To make this vision come to life, Dentsply Sirona was looking for a strong partner to help them build a solution that would bring all the dental applications safely into the cloud. This cloud platform, called DS Core, would allow dentists and laboratories to collaborate seamlessly with each other, making the workflow more efficient and the treatment span shorter for the patient.
