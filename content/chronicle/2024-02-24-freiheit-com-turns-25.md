On February 24th, freiheit.com hits a remarkable milestone – our 25th birthday! For 25 years, our mission has been clear: delivering custom, large-scale software platforms on time, on budget, and on target.

We have been in this industry for over a quarter of a century now. On our journey, we've partnered with visionaries, the ones who see things differently. The people who know that when you want to accomplish something great and unusual you have to find a new way or make one. With that and a great strong community, we delivered 350+ successful large-scale projects.

Never failed. Never late.

Here's to 25 years of doing what we love. What others can’t or won’t. With great people around us. Thank you for being part of our journey. And this still feels like just the beginning. Here's to many more years of transforming ideas into great software solutions!
