### Culture nights

Because there are so many nations present within the freiheit.com community, we host culture nights.

Each month one or a group of members presents their culture - cook their traditional food, show their traditional music and tell us about their traditional customs. Our members baked Polish pastries, taught the others Egyptian dances, made Indian samosas, gave the best French wine tastingâ€¦ the list goes on.
