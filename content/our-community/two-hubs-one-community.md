### Two hubs, one community

freiheit.com was founded in Hamburg, but it has grown far beyond that. In 2018 we opened our second engineering hub in Lisbon.

Our hub in Lisbon operates under the same organizational principles and team structures as our headquarters in Hamburg. The engineering members work together seamlessly and often in mixed teams between the two hubs, sharing knowledge and expertise across borders. 

Additionally, our members regularly travel between our engineering hubs. The newbies from Lisbon come to Hamburg for their first two weeks of onboarding to connect with our company culture. Obviously, they don’t just come to work. A big part of the trip is exploring Hamburg and enjoying time with their new colleagues. Every year, the whole company meets for our Summer and Christmas Events.
