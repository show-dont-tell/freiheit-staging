### Hackertalks

Every Friday, our engineering members organize a Hackertalk.

We are an engineering organization. 85% of our members are engineers with backgrounds in Computer Science, Physics or Mathematics, many also with strong machine learning backgrounds. We tackle new and interesting problems all the time and very often create things that nobody has built before.

Thatâ€™s why our freiheit.com engineers meet for Hackertalks every Friday. Some members enjoy a drink afterward in our community area on the 6th floor, overlooking the port of Hamburg. Each week, one member shares insights into current projects or discusses new technologies.

The topics range from theoretical physics, different types of file restoration techniques to the latest computer game technology.

Keep an eye on our [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/freiheit-com-technologies-gmbh/) to join for a public hackertalk.
