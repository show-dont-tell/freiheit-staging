### Our Ways of Working

In small, cross-functional teams, we have been building successful software products for digital business models iteratively and data-driven for over {{< years_since_founding >}} years. Each Team includes a Team Lead, who is a software engineer thyself and writes code every day. Team Leads are also usually trained as Product Owners and are appreciated as contacts for the Product Owner on the client side. A Site Reliability Engineer works with each team to automate all development and operational processes and establishes effective monitoring. Each team is completed by experienced UI/UX Designers, an Engineering Director for major technological decisions and a Commercial Lead who also keeps an eye on the teamâ€™s KPIs.
