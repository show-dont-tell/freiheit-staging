### We Are Software Engineers

We see software development as an engineering discipline. We focus on simplicity, lean and iterative engineering - and fast delivery processes since our foundation and long before “agile” became a buzzword.

Good software engineering means “keeping it simple”. We are building the simplest “software machine” with as few parts, mechanisms and dependencies as possible.

Simple is not easy.

Becoming a well-rounded software engineer is a long journey that takes many years of hard work and learning. Technology never rests. And neither do we.

We are for engineers, by engineers.
