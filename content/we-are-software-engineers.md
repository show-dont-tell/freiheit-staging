### We are software engineers.

We see software development as an engineering discipline. We focus on simplicity, lean and iterative engineering – and fast delivery processes since our foundation and long before “agile” became a buzzword.

Good software engineering means “keeping it simple”. We are building the simplest “software machine” with as few parts, mechanisms and dependencies as possible.

Simple does not mean easy.

Working at freiheit.com is an exciting adventure, with the goal to become a well-rounded software engineer who is able to plan, create, operate and lead large-scale systems in a team of software engineers.

A software company built for engineers by engineers.

We move as fast as technology does. So we use AI to our advantage. For more efficiency, simplicity, uniformity and continuity. But of course, we don’t stop using our brains.
