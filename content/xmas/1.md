### Merry Christmas

In 2023, our teams finished over 38000 user stories in more than 10 large-scale software projects of the highest strategic importance for our worldwide clients.

Both our engineering hubs in Hamburg and Lisbon are thriving. Our Portuguese team has moved into a new office in the heart of Lisbon, and now at the end of the year, we are already looking for new spaces. In Hamburg, we added a new floor.

Humanity is getting closer and closer to AGI, and we are sending starships to the Moon and - in a not-so-distant future - to Mars.

Whatever the future will bring: We are optimistic about it.

Or, as we always say: “We will find a way or make one.”

Let’s tackle the challenging problems together in 2024 and beyond.

We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
