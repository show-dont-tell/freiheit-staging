This year, we've chosen to support our neighbors: Kiezhelden represents the social commitment of FC St. Pauli. Many individuals and groups from the fan scene and club departments are deeply involved in social areas, shaping the club's image. FC St. Pauli itself takes responsibility for society, undertaking social and sociopolitical projects and events or providing support for them.

Our neighborhood often takes center stage, but some projects also extend beyond the borders of St. Pauli and Hamburg. It's always crucial for Kiezhelden to consolidate efforts and, together with like-minded individuals, achieve the best possible solutions for and with those affected.

Here, you'll find a diverse selection of projects supported by the Kiezhelden donation fund in the past months.

One of the many great organizations that Kiezhelden supports is, for example, "Verwaiste Eltern und Geschwister Hamburg e.V.", which aims to help children and young people to deal with grief after the loss of a loved one.
