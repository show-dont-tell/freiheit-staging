### Stand with Iranian Women

[HÁWAR.help](https://www.hawar.help/en/) has accompanied and supported the feminist revolution in Iran from the beginning and sees itself as an ally and an advocate for the freedom movement and for human and women’s rights in Iran. They stand up for these very rights internationally and condemn the horrible practices of the Iranian regime, which violates and disregards these rights every day.

Every year, freiheit.com devotes a significant sum of money to charity. When we heard of the tragic story of Jina Mahsa Amini and the inspiring uprising in Iran, our decision was made. We partnered with Hawar Help, a human rights organization that strives to build a peaceful and harmonious world, in which every human being can heal and grow in safety and with agency, regardless of their ethnic background, faith, gender or lifestyle. Our donation will fund educational work to make sure the fight for women’s rights in Iran is not forgotten about.
