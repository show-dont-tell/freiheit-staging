We helped cosnova bring best-in-class user experience to their customers by rebuilding the two webshops for their brands Catrice and essence, delivering on a tight deadline. The webpages were rolled out in over 80 countries worldwide and provide high performance using the Next JS framework. The page scored "green" on Google's Lighthouse test, indicating low page load times and a short time to be interactive for the page’s users. We rebuilt the UI Component Library using React and (S)CSS to optimize the user experience on both webshops across multiple devices. Additionally, we connected a headless e-commerce system through go microservices. Our iterative approach allowed for a fast ready-to-market release with a significantly improved user experience.

Both webshops have an identical backend structure but a different and individualized frontend design to transport the spirit of each brand. This simplifies the initial development while enabling a straightforward process when new features are added in the future.
