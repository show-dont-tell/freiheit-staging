Over 30 months, four teams developed a flutter-based solution connected to an Azure backend in the cloud, that is currently used by more than 200 stores of EDEKA â€“ the largest German supermarket corporation. More retail stores from the EDEKA group are to follow.

Together with EDEKA DIGITAL, the IT subsidiary of EDEKA headquarters, we designed and implemented a new mobile inventory management solution (Warenwirtschaftssystem) to support all processes in their supermarkets. Our mission was to replace the outdated offline-only version developed by a third party. Daily deployments enable the teams to rapidly implement user feedback. The improved user experience simplified the daily work of thousands of EDEKA employees using the new solution. All milestones of this 30-months project were reached on time and on budget, and future extensions/adaptations of the software can be easily implemented by EDEKA.
