### Settings on github

The locally generated pages in the directory `/docs` are committed to the git main branch.
Its content is then delivered as a github page.

The settings for Github pages at
https://github.com/freiheit-com/freiheit-com.github.io/settings/pages are
blocked. It actually looks like Github pages are not active for the repository.
If changes need to be done, an organization admin has to grant the privilege
"Pages creation > Public" at
https://github.com/organizations/freiheit-com/settings/member_privileges.

For the pages to be delivered under their own domain, a file named CNAME must be created in the
repository in the toplevel with the name CNAME, which contains the external
contains the external domain name freiheit.com

This makes it possible that for requests with the host header freiheit.com the pages are delivered
are delivered. At the same time it prevents that the page is also delivered under
freiheit-com.github.io and thus prevents duplicate content.

Also, requests to www.freiheit.com are redirected to freiheit.com.
(This setting can also be seen under Settings -> Domain Name).
